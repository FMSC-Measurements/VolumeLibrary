      ROUTINE(S): 

		Modified routines:

		crzbiomass.f
		volumelibrary.f

		New Routines:


            
      MAIN TOPIC: 
	(1)Added subroutines for R program to call the library. The added subroutines for R are: vernum_r, getvoleq_r and vollib_r
	(2)Updated biomass calculation for small trees (DBH<5). When stem merch volume is calculated to a smaller top diameter (TOPD < 4),
           the stem component biomass will also be calculeted.


     RESULT/IMPACT: 
        Small tree (DBH<5) stem component biomass if the tree has merch cubic volume calculated for the stem.
