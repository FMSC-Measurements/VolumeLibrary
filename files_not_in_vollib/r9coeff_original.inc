C  Region 9 Profile Model Coefficients
C  Last modified 06/07/2007
C
C  This file contains coefficients for calculation of inside-bark 
C  volumes using the equations in research paper SE-282, "Stem 
C  Profile Equations for Southern Tree Species" by A. Clark and 
C  others (1991).  The coefficients were fit specifically for the 
C  Eastern Region of the Forest Service.  Species codes 1000 and 
C  higher are for groups of related species.

C     Set arySiz to match total number of species and species groups
      integer,parameter::arySiz=52
      integer i,j,totSpp,grpIdx
      real coefA(52,4)
      real coef0(52,9)
      real coef4(52,8)
      real coef79(52,8)

C     Set grpIdx to match the index of the first species group
